## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

```
git clone the repository 
```

### Installing

```
$make
```
when the make file is compiled, run the executable as follow:
```
$./ircserv [port_number] [password]
```
##### 1\. `port_number` : 6667 as default
-  We highly recommend you to use port 6667 because IRC networks have defaulted to listening on TCP port 6667 for plain
   text connections. But you may use other ports that is under IRC assignment such as 6665-6669, for example.

##### 2\. `password` : PASS or any password of your wish


## ü§ñ Running the server <a name = "running_the_server"></a>

### Open a new terminal and use Irssi or netcat to connect
-  You can use Irssi or netcat command to connect to server. We recommend you to use nc(netcat) command with the flag 'c' so that the communication between server and client is done properly with '\r\n' ending

##### 1\. Irssi
```
$irssi
$/connect localhost [port_number] [password]
```
##### 2\. Netcat
With netcat, you need to have 'pass', 'nick', 'user' command to connect to server. You need to type 'pass' command first to secure the connection and then you can use either 'nick' or 'user' command to register
```
$nc -c localhost [port_number]
pass [password]
nick [nickname]
user [username] * * :[real_name] (real_name is optional)
```
