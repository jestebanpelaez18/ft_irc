/**
 * @brief The QUIT command is used to terminate a clientâ€™s connection to the server. The server acknowledges 
 * this by replying with an ERROR message and closing the connection to the client.
 * Syntax: PASS [<reason>]
 *
 * This message may also be sent from the server to a client to show that a client has exited from the network. 
 * This is typically only dispatched to clients that share a channel with the exiting user. 
 * When the QUIT message is sent to clients, <source> represents the client that has exited the network.
 * 
 *
 * Example : /QUIT Gone to have lunc
